            Although it's more common to hear stories of dogs 
            getting sick from chocolate ingestion, chocolate can also pose a serious 
            health risk to cats, even becoming fatal if too much is eaten.
        </p>
        <h1> Why Is Chocolate Bad for Cats?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:30px">
            Although sugar, fat and xylitol (a sugar substitute)
            aren't good for cats either, chocolate contains two ingredients
            that pose a threat to an animal's health: caffeine and theobromine, 
            a plant alkaloid that occurs naturally in cacao.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:30px">
         The Latin name for the cocoa plant is <em>Theobroma Cacao,</em>
        meaning "food for the gods," and the roasted beans do make a yummy treat, 
        but what makes chocolate so delightful for humans is exactly what makes it
         so dangerous for pets.</p>
         <h1>
            Why Are These Ingredients so Dangerous for Animals?
         </h1>

         <p style="font-size:30px">
         The two main culprits, caffeine and theobromine, are stimulants.
         Caffeine, found in many foo and drink items besides chocolate,
         becomes toxic when absorbed into you cat's body, leadind to
         "vomitind, diarrhea, increased thirst, restlessness and an increased heart rate,"
         explains <b>Banfield Pet Hospital.</b> Theobromine causes similar symptoms when ingested.

         <p style="font-size:30px">
        As you would with any medical emergency, immediately bring your cat to
        the vet or animal emergency room to determine the extent of the poisoning
        and to receive treatment. After treatment continue to monitor 
        your cat for any other ill effects to ensure it is completely out of her system.
        A few side effects of chocolate toxicity are listed below, but there can be a range of 
        signs ranging from mild to severe:

        What Happens Next?
        </h1>
         <p style="font-size:30px">
         Remain as calm as possible because cats are very in-tune with their
          pet parents' emotions. Try to keep them cool, calm and in a quiet 
          place to help keep the symptoms of chocolate poisoning from escalating.
         </p>
         <p style="font-size:30px">
         Once you arrive at the office, the veterinarian will examine 
         your cat and assess the amount and type of chocolate your cat has eaten.  
         The vet may want to induce vomiting to help prevent your cat from absorbing 
         the toxins and provide fluids and additional care depending on the amount of 
         chocolate consumed and the signs your cat is experiencing. 
        </p>
        <h1> 
            How Do I Prevent This from Happening?
        </h1>
        <p style="font-size:30px">
            Chocolate ingestion is 100 percent preventable: keep chocolate out of paw's 
            reach. <b>Cats are curious, unpredictable creatures</b> and love to snoop 
            around the kitchen, so secure all chocolate in a tightly sealed container.
            Think of all the things that might contain chocolate including brownies, donuts, 
            cookies, candies, etc., because it's not just the chocolate bars that can make them 
            sick. This is especially true around holidays like <em>Halloween.</em>
             If you're entertaining, place candy dishes in places that are difficult for  
             your cat to reach and store them securely immediately after the party. If a guest 
             asks, "can cats eat chocolate?", you are now prepared to answer with a resounding "no."
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:30px">
        Pet parents do like to reward their feline friends, and you can do so safely by
         sticking to safe <b>cat treats,</b> created to keep your cat happy and healthy. Then you get 
         to keep the chocolate all to yourself!
